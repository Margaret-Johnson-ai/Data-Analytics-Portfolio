# Unequal Burden: COVID-19’s Disproportionate Impact on NJ Healthcare Systems and Underserved Communities

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was created to help me explore how the COVID-19 pandemic affected healthcare systems across New Jersey, especially in low-income and underserved communities. As someone new to data analysis and passionate about public health, I wanted to dig into real-world data to better understand how access to care and hospital resources differed between counties.

Throughout this project, I worked with open datasets to look at hospitalization numbers, death rates, and population data. My goal was to compare these factors across different counties and income levels to see where the healthcare system may have been under the most pressure. I also wanted to use this project to grow my technical skills while asking meaningful questions about equity and preparedness during a public health crisis.

## 🌟 Objectives
- Explore and compare hospitalization and death rates across NJ counties during COVID-19
- Identify how outcomes may differ between low-income and high-income areas
- Visualize geographic differences in healthcare burden
- Practice using data to suggest ways to better prepare for future emergencies

## ❓ Core Questions This Project Answers
1. Which New Jersey counties experienced the most strain on their hospitals relative to their population size?
2. Is there a clear link between hospital capacity and COVID-19 death rates?
3. Were lower-income counties hit harder in terms of access to care and overall outcomes?
4. What can this data tell us about how to improve support and resources for under-resourced areas in future health emergencies?
