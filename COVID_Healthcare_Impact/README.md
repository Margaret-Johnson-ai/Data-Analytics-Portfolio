🦠 COVID-19 Healthcare Impact in New Jersey
**Phase 1: Data Cleaning & Preparation Completed**

Hi! I’m Margaret Johnson. This project is part of my Data Analytics portfolio and focuses on exploring how COVID-19 impacted counties in New Jersey — especially when viewed through the lens of median household income.

I’ve completed Phase 1: cleaning and organizing three public datasets. Next, I’ll begin analyzing trends, generating visual insights, and answering the project’s guiding question.

🎯 Project Objective
To investigate whether New Jersey counties with lower median household income experienced higher COVID-19 death rates and outbreak severity compared to higher-income counties.
❓ Guiding Research Question
Is there a relationship between median income and COVID-19 death rates across counties in NJ?
✅ Current Progress: Phase 1 Completed
Here's what’s been done so far:
•	Collected 3 public datasets (Deaths, Income, LTC Outbreaks): https://github.com/Margaret-Johnson-ai/Data-Analytics-Portfolio/tree/main/COVID_Healthcare_Impact/Raw_Datasets
•	Cleaned datasets using KNIME workflows: https://github.com/Margaret-Johnson-ai/Data-Analytics-Portfolio/tree/main/COVID_Healthcare_Impact/KNIME_Workflow
•	Exported cleaned files: https://github.com/Margaret-Johnson-ai/Data-Analytics-Portfolio/tree/main/COVID_Healthcare_Impact/Final_Exports
•	Documented every step with screenshots: https://github.com/Margaret-Johnson-ai/Data-Analytics-Portfolio/tree/main/COVID_Healthcare_Impact/Screenshots
•	Merging datasets for analysis: In Progress
•	Creating visualizations and reports: Coming Soon
