# ü©∫ COVID-19 Healthcare Impact in New Jersey  
_A Data Cleaning & Analysis Project_

---

## üéØ Project Purpose

This project investigates how COVID-19 impacted healthcare systems and outcomes across counties in New Jersey. By combining data from federal and state health sources, the goal is to uncover how death rates, LTCF (Long-Term Care Facility) deaths, and county income levels are interrelated.

---

## ‚ùì Key Questions to Answer During Analysis

- What counties experienced the **highest COVID-19 death rates**?
- Is there a relationship between **income level** and **COVID-19 mortality**?
- How did **long-term care facilities** contribute to total death counts?
- Which counties were **most vulnerable** based on combined metrics?

## üìä Visual Insights

### üîπ Bar Chart: Avg Monthly COVID-19 Deaths by County

![Realistic Bar Chart](EDA_Visuals/Realistic_Avg_Monthly_Deaths_BarChart.png)

- Depicts **monthly COVID-19 death averages** (not cumulative).
- Shows impact across counties like **Bergen**, **Essex**, and **Hudson**.
- Values are based on CDC cumulative data converted to daily deltas and averaged by month.

---

### üîπ Scatter Plot: Median Income vs. Avg Monthly COVID-19 Deaths

![Income vs Deaths Scatter](EDA_Visuals/Income_vs_Deaths_Scatter.png)

- Plots **income** vs **monthly COVID deaths** to reveal inverse correlation.
- Lower-income counties like **Essex** saw higher death averages.
- Higher-income counties like **Hunterdon** show lower death rates.

---

### üîπ Correlation Heatmap: LTCF Deaths, Income, Avg COVID Deaths

![LTCF Heatmap](Phase_2_LTCF_Correlation/LTCF_Income_Deaths_Correlation_Heatmap.png)

- Strong positive correlation between **LTCF deaths** and **avg monthly deaths** (`0.81`)
- Weak negative correlation between **income** and **COVID-19 deaths** (`-0.18`)
- Demonstrates LTCF impact is a more significant factor than income alone

---

## üí° Insights Summary

- **LTCF deaths** are a key driver of overall mortality in some counties.
- **Income alone** is not a strong predictor of COVID-19 death outcomes.
- Combining LTCF, income, and death data provides a richer picture of health vulnerability.

---

## üß† What I Learned

- Data wrangling and cleaning with KNIME  
- Dataset merging and correlation analysis with Pandas  
- Creating insightful charts with Seaborn and Matplotlib  
- Organizing real-world health data into a clean storytelling portfolio  

---

## üöß Next Steps (Phase 3 Planning)

- [ ] Analyze ICU utilization from NJ Hospital dataset  
- [ ] Detect county-level risk clusters using unsupervised learning  
- [ ] Develop a dynamic dashboard using Streamlit or Tableau

## üìå Summary

This project demonstrates foundational data analytics, public health insight, and storytelling. Phase 1 and 2 have covered county-level mortality, income impact, and LTCF vulnerability. Phase 3 will build on this foundation with advanced analysis and interactivity.

### ‚úÖ Key Findings Summary

After analyzing the data from multiple public sources, here‚Äôs what the findings revealed:

- **Counties with the highest COVID-19 death rates:**  
  The data showed that counties such as **Bergen**, **Essex**, and **Hudson** consistently reported the highest average monthly deaths from COVID-19 between 2020 and 2023.

- **Relationship between income and COVID-19 mortality:**  
  There was a **weak inverse correlation** between median household income and average COVID-19 death rates. While lower-income counties often experienced more deaths, income alone was not a strong predictor of mortality.

- **Impact of long-term care facility outbreaks:**  
  A strong correlation (**0.81**) was found between LTCF-related deaths and overall average monthly COVID-19 deaths. This indicates that outcomes in long-term care facilities were a key driver of county-level mortality.

- **Counties most vulnerable based on combined metrics:**  
  Counties like **Essex** emerged as particularly vulnerable, exhibiting high LTCF death totals, lower income levels, and elevated monthly death averages. This suggests a convergence of socioeconomic and healthcare-related risk factors.

These results highlight the value of combining datasets to better understand public health challenges. By merging and visualizing these insights, I was able to uncover trends that wouldn‚Äôt have been visible from a single source alone.
