## ðŸ§  What I Learned

- How to extract and transform complex public datasets into clean, analyzable formats
- How to apply best practices for naming conventions, string manipulation, and value filtering in KNIME
- How to document data cleaning steps with visuals and descriptive commit history for transparency and reproducibility

## ðŸš§ Next Steps (Phase 2: EDA â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis)

- [ ] Create bar charts showing COVID-19 deaths vs. income by county
- [ ] Generate correlation heatmaps between ICU bed use, death rates, and income levels
- [ ] Add all visuals under a new `/EDA_Visuals/` folder
- [ ] Document key takeaways and trends in this README

## âœ… Final Note

This project is part of my Data Analytics Portfolio and showcases real-world data wrangling, documentation, and visualization skills. It highlights my ability to clean messy datasets, structure projects for clarity, and communicate findings in a professional way.

Feel free to explore the files, workflows, and screenshots, and follow my GitHub for continued updates as I complete the EDA phase.
