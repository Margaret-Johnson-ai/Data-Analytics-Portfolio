👋 About This Project
As an aspiring data analyst passionate about public health, I built this portfolio project to explore how the COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately impacted New Jersey counties — especially low-income and underserved communities. Using KNIME and real-world datasets, I walked through hands-on cleaning, transformation, and analysis techniques to extract insights from healthcare and demographic data.
🎯 Project Objectives

- Explore and compare hospitalization and death rates across NJ counties during COVID-19
- Identify how outcomes may differ between low-income and high-income areas
- Visualize geographic differences in healthcare burden
- Practice using data to suggest ways to better prepare for future emergencies

❓ Core Questions This Project Answers

1. Which New Jersey counties experienced the most strain on their hospitals relative to their population size?
2. Is there a clear link between hospital capacity and COVID-19 death rates?
3. Were lower-income counties hit harder in terms of access to care and overall outcomes?
4. What can this data tell us about how to improve support and resources for under-resourced areas in future health emergencies?

🛠️ Tools Used

- KNIME – for cleaning, joining, and transforming datasets
- Excel – for data review and optional dashboards
- Tableau Public – for visualizations (optional)
- GitHub – for sharing my work and documenting the project

📊 Key Metrics Being Analyzed

- Deaths per county (daily and cumulative)
- Median income by county
- LTC resident/staff case outcomes
- Population-adjusted impact measures

🧠 Reflections

This project helped me improve:
- Real-world dataset cleaning using KNIME
- Understanding of socioeconomic health disparities
- Documenting and showcasing data work on GitHub

I'm excited to continue expanding this project with dashboards, Tableau visualizations, and final analysis findings.
